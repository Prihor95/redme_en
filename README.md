## Selected Projects  

### OEE & Production Loss Dashboard  
**Challenge:** Time-consuming manual reporting at a mass-production cup manufacturing plant caused delayed weekly meetings with dispersed data across multiple files.  

**Solution:**  
- Standardized data collection into a single Excel source  
- Developed interactive Power BI dashboard  
- Trained operators on proper data entry protocols  

**Impact:**  
- Reduced reporting time from 2 days to 1 shift  
- Enabled real-time performance comparisons  
- Served as primary analysis tool for DMAIC improvement teams  
- 25% reduction in printing waste through defect visualization  

**Tools:**

### Gym Membership Retention Analysis  
**Objective:** Predict next-month member churn using machine learning (binary classification) and identify high-risk customer segments.  

**Methodology:**  
1. **EDA:** Identified cancellation patterns through heatmap analysis  
2. **Modeling:** Compared Logistic Regression (85% accuracy) vs. Random Forest (84% accuracy)  
3. **Clustering:** Segmented users by behavior patterns using K-means  

**Key Insights:**  
- Cluster #2 (20.5% of users) showed highest churn risk:  
  - Ages 25-30  
  - 67.6% without workout partners  
  - Located near facilities  
- Strong correlation between class attendance frequency and retention

**Recommendations:**  
- Targeted SMS campaigns (90% phone number coverage)  
- A/B test promotional offers for high-risk segments  
- Encourage group activities for younger members

### Telecom Operator Performance System  
**Solution:** Developed operator scoring algorithm evaluating:  
1. Missed call rates  
2. Wait times  
3. Outbound call volume  

**Analysis Highlights:**  
- Confirmed relationship between service plans and missed calls (p < 0.05)  
- Efficient operators made 42% more outbound calls (t-test verified)  
- Identified 56 underperforming operators for targeted training  

**Deliverables:**  
- Interactive Tableau dashboard for supervisor oversight
